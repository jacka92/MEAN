This is a prototype for an out of the box MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular.js, Node.js) application.

Building the application

1) Install npm (node packaged modules) if not currently present with:

$ sudo apt-get install npm

2) Run the run.sh file - this will install node dependencies, install mongodb and run the mongo server

3) Run the www file in the bin directory with Node. The app will launch on port 3000 of local host.

The mongo shell can be run by opening a new terminal window and running mongo db to access the 'rtr' database.
